## Project Overview
The notebook performs the following steps:
1. **Data loading and cleaning**: Loads and cleans the dataset.
2. **Data visualization**: Creates visualizations for diseases and symptoms.
3. **Model training and evaluation**: Defines a set of classifiers, trains them, and evaluates their performance.
4. **Prediction and result display**: Uses the trained model to predict diseases based on symptoms and displays the results along with descriptions and precautions.

## Data
The project uses three datasets:
1. `dataset.csv`: Contains symptoms and diseases data.
2. `symptom_Description.csv`: Contains descriptions for each disease.
3. `symptom_precaution.csv`: Contains precautions for each disease.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `catboost`, `wordcloud`, `numpy`, `pickle`.

You can install the required libraries using:
\`\`\`bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost wordcloud numpy pickle
\`\`\`

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/juniorworku/disease-symptom-prediction.git
   cd disease-symptom-prediction
   \`\`\`

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   \`\`\`bash
   jupyter notebook Prediction-and-Analysis.ipynb
   \`\`\`

3. **Follow the steps in the notebook**:
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Perform data visualization to understand the distribution of symptoms and diseases.
   - Split the dataset into training, test, and validation sets.
   - Train various classifiers and evaluate their performance.
   - Use the trained model to make predictions and display results along with descriptions and precautions.

## Results
The notebook trains multiple classifiers and evaluates their performance using F1 Score and AUC-ROC Score. The results for each classifier are displayed in the notebook, including cross-validation scores, test scores, and validation scores.
